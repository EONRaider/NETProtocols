# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **IEEE 802.1Q VLAN tags** (`VLAN`, 802.1Q-2018 §9.6 / 802.1ad QinQ):
  single and stacked (QinQ `0x88A8`, legacy double-tagged `0x9100`)
  tags decode as one layer per tag; the Tag Control Information word is
  split into `pcp`/`dei`/`vid` dataclass fields validated in
  `__post_init__` (`InvalidFieldError`), with the packed 16-bit view
  kept as the `tci` property; `VLAN` is registered in the
  property-based fuzz suite and the `EtherType` display names are
  covered by the enum completeness test.

### Development
- The real-capture fixture corpus gained `vlan_icmp.pcap` (802.1Q
  single tag VID 100 + 802.1ad QinQ S-VID 200 / C-VID 30, over ARP and
  ICMPv4), so the `VLAN` layer rides the corpus-wide invariants and the
  transport-checksum recompute like every other protocol. The tags are
  spliced over a real untagged capture (the CI/dev kernel lacks the
  `8021q` driver) — genuine inner checksums, byte-identical to trunk
  output; see `tests/fixtures/MANIFEST.md` and
  `scripts/capture_fixtures_vlan.sh`.
- Contributor documentation: a `CONTRIBUTING.md` (dev setup, the QA
  ladder, the decode contract, the add-a-protocol enforcement points,
  and the fixture-capture workflow) and a pull-request template under
  `.github/`.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-30

### Added
- **IGMP** (`netprotocols.IGMP`, RFC 1112/2236/3376) — IPv4 multicast
  group management, dispatched from IPv4 protocol 2. The common
  four-byte header (type, max-response code, checksum) is decoded; the
  `group_address` accessor reads the group for the message types that
  carry one, and `netprotocols.checksum` gains an IGMP arm. v3
  group-record parsing is a roadmap follow-up.
- **DNS** (`netprotocols.DNS`, RFC 1035) — the first application-layer
  protocol. The 12-byte header and flag bits are decoded; the four
  message sections are kept raw with on-demand, read-only accessors
  (`question_name`, `question_type`, `question_class`) that decompress
  names safely (bounded pointer-following; malformed or looping names
  raise `InvalidFieldError`, never hang). Round-trip stays byte-exact.
- **Port-based dispatch** on UDP: `UDP.next_protocol()` reaches an
  application protocol by well-known port (`netprotocols.layer4._ports`,
  `{53: DNS}` for now), checked destination-then-source. Documented as
  best-effort — a mis-dispatch degrades to the malformed-frame path.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added
- **IPv6 extension headers** (RFC 8200 §4.3-4.6): `IPv6HopByHopOptions`,
  `IPv6Routing`, `IPv6Fragment`, `IPv6DestinationOptions`. The decode
  chain now reaches ICMPv6/TCP/UDP behind them (MLD reports decode
  fully). Extension headers dispatch only inside an IPv6 chain, and a
  Fragment header chains onward only from the first fragment.
- **Checksums** (`netprotocols.checksum`): `internet_checksum()`
  (RFC 1071), `compute()`/`verify()` covering the IPv4 header checksum,
  ICMPv4, and TCP/UDP/ICMPv6 with IPv4/IPv6 pseudo-headers, and
  `Packet.with_checksums()` for filling a whole stack on encode. The
  UDP-only zero substitution is confined to the UDP arm.
- **Property-based fuzzing** of the decode path (hypothesis, dev-only):
  decode() raises nothing outside `ProtocolError` for any input; the
  chain walk never consumes past the frame; constrained round trips.
- `IPProtocol` gains `HOPOPT`, `IPV6_ROUTE`, `IPV6_FRAG`,
  `IPV6_DSTOPTS` with display names.

### Development
- The real-capture fixture corpus grew to 65 frames across 12
  scenarios (MLD behind hop-by-hop, IPv6 fragment pairs); checksum
  tests recompute every verifiable corpus frame to its captured wire
  value.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-08-29

### Fixed
- `IPv4.next_protocol()` chained non-first fragments
  (`fragment_offset > 0`) into garbage upper-layer decodes — a slice
  from the middle of a fragmented payload has no header at its start.
  Discovered by the new real-capture fixture corpus on live fragmented
  traffic; the chain now ends at the IPv4 layer for those frames, as it
  already did for unknown protocols.

### Added (development)
- A real-capture fixture corpus under `tests/fixtures/` (56 frames,
  10 scenarios, every checksum internally verified — see its
  MANIFEST.md) with corpus-wide invariant tests, plus the capture and
  validation scripts under `scripts/`.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-21

Complete rewrite. The public API is new; see the README and
ARCHITECTURE.md for the current usage.

### Changed
- The parsing core moved from `ctypes.BigEndianStructure` subclasses to
  frozen, slotted dataclasses parsed with `struct.Struct`. Decoded and
  constructed instances are now identical in type and compare equal
  field-by-field.
- `next_protocol()` (returning the class that decodes the payload, or
  `None`) replaces the stringly-typed `encapsulated_proto` chain.
  Protocol number registries are exposed as `EtherType`, `IPProtocol`,
  and `ARPOperation` enums.
- `header_len` is now an instance property: IPv4 honors IHL and TCP
  honors the data offset, and both expose their raw `options` bytes.
- Field names modernized (`ethertype`, `src_port`, `total_length`,
  `checksum`, ...); display helpers are properties such as
  `protocol_name`, `flags_str`, and `checksum_hex_str`.
- Packaging moved to PEP 621 (`hatchling` + `uv`), src layout, Python
  3.12+, MIT license, `py.typed` (mypy strict clean).
- Validators are plain functions (`validate_mac_addr`,
  `validate_ipv4_addr`) raising exceptions rooted at `ProtocolError`.

### Fixed
- `TCP.header_len` was hardcoded to 32 bytes; the base header is 20 and
  the real length follows the data offset.
- Decoding ignored IPv4 IHL and TCP data offset, so headers carrying
  options were mis-sliced.
- Serialization returned a zeroed buffer (`Protocol.__str__`);
  `bytes(header)` now re-emits the exact on-wire form, options included.
- `Packet` rejected instances of indirect `Protocol` subclasses
  (e.g. `IPv4`, `ICMPv4`) due to validation against direct subclasses
  only; membership is now checked with `isinstance`.
- Malformed input (truncated buffers, lying IHL/data-offset values) now
  raises typed exceptions (`TruncatedHeaderError`, `InvalidFieldError`)
  instead of arbitrary `ValueError`/`struct.error` leaks.

### Removed
- The `Validator` descriptor infrastructure (it stored state on the
  descriptor itself — class-shared — and was never wired into any
  protocol class).
- Poetry manifests and the `setup.py`-era metadata.

## [0.8.0] - 2022-08-19

Last release of the ctypes-based implementation, published to PyPI in
2022. The repository had drifted behind the published releases; the
0.8.0 sources were recovered from the PyPI sdist and committed (tagged
`v0.8.0`) before the 1.0.0 rewrite. Releases 0.4.4 through 0.8.0 exist
on PyPI only; their individual histories were not preserved.
